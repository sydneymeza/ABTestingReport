      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Actually finding how effecitive a small change can make is very
        difficult, luckily we cant use AB testing/statistics to do this. For
        this assignment I was able to test two differnt interfaces, one that was
        prepared for me to use, and the other is the one with the changes that I
        made. This was a great opportunity to learn about AB testing and see
        what information can be found from using statistics and different
        methods.

        The parts of the website that I chose to redesign include changing the
        colors, of the buttons, the arrangment of the buttons, the arrangement
        of the appointment details, and the arrangement of the appointments
        themselves I wanted to change the button colors t omake it more clear
        which button was the'make an appointment' button, and which one was to
        view the details. I also changed the arrangement so that the buttons
        were in a row rather than set in a column. The reasoning behind this was
        to allow for more clickable space so that there are no accidental
        clicks. I rearranged the appointment details by having the doctor's name
        be the first detail that is seen, it's now the appointment header rather
        than what type of appointment it is. I rearranged the appointments by
        having them be in ascending order by dates rather than a bunch of dates
        mixed up. I had this idea so that it would be easier to see the dates in
        order.

      <h1>Data Collection</h1>
      <p>
        I took part and my classmates took part in this AB testing assignment.
        We first all 'tested' the A verison of the interface by being assigned a
        task, which was to schedule an appointment with a specific doctor, on a
        specific day, in a specific place. All my classmates were assigned the
        same tasks and that is where the data comes for the A version. After I
        was able to make changes to the website, and then we tested each others
        websites, so the same people tested both version A and B of this test.

      <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
      <p>
        The data points that I chose to create hypothesis for include, the
        misclick rate, the time spent on page, and the total distance (in
        pixels) that the mouse moved.
      </p>

      <table>

          <th></th>

        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <h2>Misclick Rate</h2>
        <p>
          The type of test that I chose to use for this metric is the two-tailed
          test. I thought that this would be the best test for this metric
          because I wanted to compare the two averages. I know that since both
          variables are continuous then ...

          <br />
          The average percent of people that made a misclick for version A is
          26%. The percent of people that made a misclick on version B is 4%.
          The p-value is 0.04 which is less than then alpha thus we can reject
          the null hypothesis.
        </p>

        <h2>Time spent on Page</h2>

          <br />
          The average time spent on the page of version A is ____. The average
          time spent on the page of version A is ____. The p-value is 0.04 which
          is less than then alpha thus we can reject the null hypothesis.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        While I didn't use a variety of test, I feel comfortable using the tests
        that I did do to analyze A/B testing. I hope to learn more about the
        other tests in the future so that I can use the data more extensively.
        As the tests that I did for this assignment were informative, but I
        believe that there is other information that I could have seen had I
        analyzed or tested the data in a different way.
